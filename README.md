# Resplash
This website is a clone of the popular photo repository Unsplash. It allows the user to have their own photography profile, display their photos, and related photos to each post. 

## Features
- Main page with collection of all photographer's photo posts. 
- Photographer profile with contact info and a place to display all their posted photos in chronological order.
- Pop up upon hovering over photographer name or avatar that allows user to see 3 most recent posts and link to their profile.
- At the bottom of each post related photos using the category and tag system.

## Technologies Used 
- WordPress
- PHP
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Lessons Learned 
- Creating a WordPress plugin from scratch that displays the photographer's name and avatar with a hover effect showing the last three post by that photographer. It also displays below the post any other posts that have related tags.
- Using Hooks and Filters to create an adapatable plugin for different themes and layouts.
- Wordpress Theme development in order to display the photos in a specific design and utilize categories properly.
- Improved my PHP programming skills by working with custom plugins and themes.
- 

  ## Future Improvements
  - A place where the users can make comments on the photos.
  - A rating system like Reddit or Youtube where user's can up or downvote posts.
  - The ability to like a post and save it to your profile.
